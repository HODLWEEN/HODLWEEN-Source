	<p>Wait, what is HODL?! In 2013, an internet troll posted a drunk rant online, which included misspelling of the word HOLD. It's now a well known meme in the Bitcoin community, and evolved into meaning "Hold On for Dear Life"! Get ready, because it's time to hodl. Like that troll, this is your opportunity to revel in disguise!</p>
